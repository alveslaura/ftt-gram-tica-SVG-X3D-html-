# ftt-grammar-SVG/X3D(html)


This challenge consists of creating a parser to read a txt file with a grammar (defined by the student), to process the production rules and as output, generate an SVG or X3D file with a corresponding graphic.

-This parser will generate graphics based on L-Systems.

1. Read file with grammar (format defined by the student);

2. Apply production rules;

3. Generate the graphic in an SVG, HTML + SVG or X3D format file as output;

4. Provide README.TXT file with its syntax and grammar semantics;

>> Input: Grammar >> Processing: Production Rules >> Output: Graphic in SVG or X3D file (HTML);

-This project explores the "Create" cognitive levels according to Bloom's taxonomy.
